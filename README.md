# kaleidoscope-eyes
This project uses OpenCV, Pandas, and Numpy to return the RGB values of a specified point on an image. 

# Directions
First, git clone the code into the directory of your choice. From there, place the image you
would like to color check into the directory and name it "image.jpg". 
Next, run the program using python main.py, this should open a window with the image inside. 
Use the cursor and double click the point on the image that you would like to color check. 
Once double clicked, the RGB values should appear in the top right corner of the window. 
To exit, press the ESC key. 

# NOTE:
Please make sure that OpenCV, Pandas, and Numpy are installed to ensure that the program works properly.
