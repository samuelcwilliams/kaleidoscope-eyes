# kaleidoscope-eyes is a project which uses cv2 for python, as well as numpy and pandas to 
# return the RGB values of a color.

# Directions
# First, git clone the code into the directory of your choice. From there, place the image you
# would like to color check into the directory and name it "image.jpg". 
# Next, run the program using python main.py, this should open a window with the image inside. 
# Use the cursor and double click the point on the image that you would like to color check. 
# Once double clicked, the RGB values should appear in the top right corner of the window.
